## Introduction
In my C class I was tasked to implement an edit buffer. An edit buffer is commonly used in text editors. There were a few data structures I could use to accomplish this task with; I went with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer" target="_blank">gap buffer</a>.

## Setup
### On Windows
#### The-Convenient-But-Not-So-Safe-Way 
Simply download EditBufferMain.exe and run. Windows Defender will probably mark the program as a virus; it is not but who is taking risks here?    
#### The-Slightly-Less-Convenient-But-Much-Safer-Way
Download and extract the ZIP. Navigate to its directory and check the source files for malicious code. Compile. You will have to link `EditBuffer.c` and `main.c`. Run.

### Other Operating Systems
Download and extract the ZIP. Navigate to its directory and check the source files for malicious code. Compile. You will have to link `EditBuffer.c` and `main.c`. Run.

## Technologies
* C

## Features
* ASCII based GUI
* Buffer automatically resizes as needed
* Input Validation

## What I Learned
* Structs, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory Allocation
