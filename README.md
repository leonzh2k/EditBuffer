## Setup
### On Windows
The-Convenient-But-Not-So-Safe-Way: Simply download EditBufferMain.exe and run. Windows Defender will probably mark the program as a virus; it is not but who is taking risks here?    
The-Slightly-Less-Convenient-But-Much-Safer-Way: Download and extract the ZIP. Navigate to its directory and check the source files for malicious code. Compile. You will have to link `EditBuffer.c` and `main.c`.

### Other Operating Systems
Download and extract the ZIP. Navigate to its directory and check the source files for malicious code. Compile. You will have to link `EditBuffer.c` and `main.c`.
